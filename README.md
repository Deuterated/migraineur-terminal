# migraineur-terminal
settings I have found helpful in reducing the impact of migraine-related photophobia


This terminal configuration is the result of months of tweaking. It's geared towards readability and reduced eye strain. Regrettably, it's not the most accessible for people who also have red-green colorblindness. Please feel free to make modifications, fork, etc; if you can make one that's colorblind-friendly and doesn't make my eyes yell at me, it will likely be pulled/merged after testing, but wouldn't displace my own version on my own machine, sorry not sorry.
